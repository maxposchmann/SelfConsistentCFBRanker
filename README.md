# Explanation:

I was looking at a couple of computer CFB rankings, and the following occurred to me:
 - I can use a computer.
 - I know about football.
 - My opinions are better than other people's opinions.
 
So of course I had to do my own ranking system. Here are my principles:
 - Games are won or lost. Point differentials are meaningless. Really, your team is better because your 8th-string QB rushed for a couple garbage time TDs?
 - Wins and losses both matter. Equally.
 - The order in which games are played doesn't matter. No late-season bias. No inertia.
 - Beating a good team is better than beating a bad team, and similarly losing to a good team isn't as bad as losing to a bad team.
 - No judgement should be involved. No adjustable paramenters. In other words, there's no seed from a preseason poll, nor should there be sorting by P5/G5 etc. The rankings themselves have to determine what is a good win.
 - The final rankings should return themselves if run through the algorithm again.
 
 The guts of the ranking are as follows: an exponential function takes the "strength" of the opponent and uses win/loss outcome to set the sign. I set all the strengths at 1 to begin with, then it iterates until self-consistency of strengths. Multiple games are counted separately, rather than cancelling. 
 One caveat about the "no inputs" thing: only FBS teams are tracked, and all non-FBS teams have strength set to (minimum FBS strength - 1.0).

# Examples:
## 2019 ##
Let's take a look at the top 25 prior to bowl games for the 2019 season. I'll use the results as of December 8th to match the final CFP committee:
| Rank |Team                  | Strength | CFP Committee Rank |
|------|----------------------|----------|--------------------|
|     1|Ohio State            |13.03838463|2|
|     2|LSU                   |12.01616332|1|
|     3|Clemson               |11.98186068|3|
|     4|Memphis               |9.99923698|17|
|     5|Oklahoma              |9.99729464|4|
|     6|Boise State           |9.99367237|19|
|     7|Appalachian State     |9.97340478|20|
|     8|Georgia               |8.02913272|5|
|     9|Notre Dame            |8.01233544|15|
|    10|Oregon                |8.01046326|6|
|    11|Baylor                |8.00007714|7|
|    12|Utah                  |7.99679531|11|
|    13|SMU                   |7.97327464|NR|
|    14|Wisconsin             |7.04910428|8|
|    15|Penn State            |7.03069900|10|
|    16|Cincinnati            |7.02213362|21|
|    17|Air Force             |6.98826336|NR|
|    18|Minnesota             |6.98195560|18|
|    19|Alabama               |6.98015348|13|
|    20|Michigan              |6.03416552|14|
|    21|Florida               |6.02048182|9|
|    22|Florida Atlantic      |6.01168040|NR|
|    23|Iowa                  |6.00884827|16|
|    24|Navy                  |6.00546245|23|
|    25|Louisiana             |5.99137361|NR|

This ranking results in 3 of the 4 playoff selection, and Oklahoma is only edged out by Memphis by a razor-thin margin. Evidently this ranking system is not the hot-take generator I had feared. In total 4 of the top-25 teams differ from the CFP committee's list. Dropped are 9-3 Auburn (12), 8-4 USC (22), 9-4 Virginia (24), and 8-4 Oklahoma State (25). Added are 10-3 SMU, 11-2 Air Force, 11-3 FAU, and 11-3 Louisiana. Overall this ranking prefers G5 teams with more wins over P5 teams with fewer, relative to the CFP. I agree.

So 2019 is a nice, uncontroversial year. LSU were champs, they deserved to be in the CFP, and after all bowls the Self-Consistent CFB Ranker agrees that they were the best.

## 2017 ##
But what about 2017? Starting with the same point (December 3rd), who should have been in the CFP?
| Rank |Team                  | Strength | CFP Committee Rank |
|------|----------------------|----------|--------------------|
|     1|UCF                   |11.00400836|12|
|     2|Wisconsin             |10.99724953|8|
|     3|Oklahoma              |10.99072388|2|
|     4|Georgia               |10.02831540|3|
|     5|Clemson               |10.02328429|1|
|     6|Ohio State            |9.03531505|5|
|     7|USC                   |9.00928820|8|
|     8|Alabama               |9.00910270|4|
|     9|Penn State            |8.01602822|9|
|    10|Toledo                |7.97257478|NR|

Well that's a bit different. According to the Self-Consistent CFB Ranker, UCF absolutely should have been given a chance to play for the title, as should Wisconsin. Clemson and Alabama, not so much.

In reality, unfortunately UCF was never given a shot. Interestingly, the Colley Matrix still put them at 1 after bowl games, even though they didn't get to face off in the CFP. Since this ranking bears some similarity in approach to Colley, let's see if that's true for the Self-Consistent CFB Ranker also.

| Rank |Team                  | Strength |
|------|----------------------|----------|
|     1|Wisconsin             |12.01306732|
|     2|UCF                   |12.00934276|
|     3|Alabama               |11.04063894|
|     4|Georgia               |10.06457717|
|     5|Ohio State            |10.05633060|
|     6|Oklahoma              |10.01675717|
|     7|Clemson               |9.04034361|
|     8|Penn State            |9.03168545|
|     9|USC                   |8.02110674|
|    10|Boise State           |8.00890270|

Sorry UCF, but congratulations to the Self-Consistent CFB Ranker 2017 national champions Wisconsin!
